  heading: Celebrations
  description: "Kids will remember an important day or festival day only if they
    are told about what the occasion signifies. So a celebration makes them to
    aware of the things in a more fun and happy way. For a child celebrating
    events and festivals in school has become an integral part of growing,
    learning new activities, and building a strong cultural belief. Celebrations
    bring the students or the children closer to each other’s cultural beliefs
    and traditions to develop respect and understanding for each other’s customs
    and traditions. "
